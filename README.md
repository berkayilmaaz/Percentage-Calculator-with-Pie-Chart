# Percentage Calculator with Pie Chart

## Overview
This Python application provides a simple yet effective graphical user interface (GUI) to calculate the percentage of a part relative to a total amount. It visualizes the calculation results in a pie chart, enhancing the user's understanding of the proportion. This tool is particularly useful in educational, financial, and statistical contexts where visual representation of data is crucial.

## Features
- **Percentage Calculation**: Calculate the percentage of a given 'part' of a 'total'.
- **Pie Chart Visualization**: Visualizes the proportion of the 'part' in relation to the 'total' using a pie chart.
- **Error Handling**: Includes validation for non-numerical and zero inputs.
- **GitHub Link**: Provides a direct link to the developer's GitHub profile.

## Installation
To run this application, you will need Python installed on your system along with the `matplotlib` library. If you don't have `matplotlib` installed, you can install it via pip:

```
pip install matplotlib
```
## Usage
1. **Start the Application**: Run the script to open the GUI.
2. **Input Data**: Enter the total amount and the part amount in their respective fields.
3. **Calculate**: Click on 'Calculate' to see the percentage and the pie chart visualization.
5. **Exit**: Click on 'Exit' to close the application.

## Examples

- **Financial Analysis**: Handy for quick calculations and visualizations of budget allocations, expense distributions, etc.
- **Data Presentation**: Useful for creating simple visual representations of data for presentations or reports.
- **Educational Use**: Can be used as a teaching tool to help students understand percentages and their visual representations.
